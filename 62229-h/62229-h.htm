<blockquote>

<p><small>MY DEAR CHILD,</small></p>

<p><i>THE story you love so much in German, I
dedicate to you in English. It was in compliance
with your earnest wish that other children might
share the delight it has so often afforded you, that I
translated it; so that it is, in some sort, yours of right.
Let us hope that your confident expectations of sympathy
in your pleasure may not be disappointed; or
that, if others think the story less beautiful than
you do, they may find compensation in the graceful
designs it has inspired.</i></p>

<p><i>You have often regretted that it left off so soon,
and would, I believe, &#8220;have been glad to hear more
and more, and for ever.&#8221; The continuation you have
longed for lies in a wide and magnificent book, which</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
<i>contains more wonderful and glorious things than all
our favourite fairy-tales put together. But to read
in that book, so as to discover all its beautiful meanings,
you must have pure, clear eyes, and a humble,
loving heart; otherwise you will complain, as some
do, that it is dim and puzzling; or, as others, that it
is dull and monotonous.</i></p>

<p><i>May you continue to read in it with new curiosity,
new delight, and new profit; and to find it, as long
as you live, the untiring &#8220;Story without an End.&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a Child who
lived in a little hut, and in
the hut there was nothing
but a little bed and a looking-glass
which hung in a dark corner.
Now the Child cared nothing at all
about the looking-glass; but as soon as
the first sunbeam glided softly through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the casement and kissed his sweet eyelids,
and the finch and the linnet waked
him merrily with their morning songs,
he arose, and went out into the green
meadow. And he begged flour of the
primrose, and sugar of the violet, and
butter of the butter-cup; he shook
dew-drops from the cowslip into the
cup of a harebell; spread out a large
lime leaf, set his little breakfast upon
it, and feasted daintily. Sometimes he
invited a humming bee, oftener a gay
butterfly, to partake his feast; but his
favourite guest was the blue dragonfly.
The bee murmured a great deal, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
solemn tone, about his riches: but
the Child thought that if <i>he</i> were a bee
heaps of treasure would not make him
gay and happy; and that it must be
much more delightful and glorious to
float about in the free and fresh breezes
of spring, and to hum joyously in the
web of the sunbeams, than, with heavy
feet and heavy heart, to stow the silver
wax and the golden honey into cells.</p>

<p>To this the butterfly assented; and he
told, how, once on a time, he too had
been greedy and sordid; how he had
thought of nothing but eating, and had
never once turned his eyes upwards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the blue heavens. At length, however,
a complete change had come over him;
and instead of crawling spiritless about
the dirty earth, half dreaming, he all at
once awaked as out of a deep sleep.
And now he would rise into the air;&mdash;and
it was his greatest joy sometimes to
play with the light, and to reflect the
heavens in the bright eyes of his wings;
sometimes to listen to the soft language
of the flowers and catch their secrets.
Such talk delighted the Child, and his
breakfast was the sweeter to him, and
the sunshine on leaf and flower seemed
to him more bright and cheering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>But when the bee had flown off to
beg from flower to flower, and the butterfly
had fluttered away to his playfellows,
the dragonfly still remained,
poised on a blade of grass. Her slender
and burnished body, more brightly and
deeply blue than the deep blue sky,
glistened in the sunbeam; and her net-like
wings laughed at the flowers because
<i>they</i> could not fly, but must stand
still and abide the wind and the rain.
The dragonfly sipped a little of the
Child&#8217;s clear dew-drops and blue violet-honey,
and then whispered her winged
words. And the Child made an end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his repast, closed his dark blue eyes,
bent down his beautiful head, and listened
to the sweet prattle.</p>

<p>Then the dragonfly told much of the
merry life in the green wood; how
sometimes she played hide-and-seek
with her playfellows under the broad
leaves of the oak and the beech trees;
or hunt-the-hare along the surface of
the still waters; sometimes quietly
watched the sunbeams, as they flew
busily from moss to flower and from
flower to bush, and shed life and warmth
over all. But at night, she said, the
moonbeams glided softly around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
wood, and dropped dew into the mouths
of all the thirsty plants; and when the
dawn pelted the slumberers with the
soft roses of heaven, some of the half
drunken flowers looked up and smiled;
but most of them could not so much as
raise their heads for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Such stories did the dragonfly tell;
and as the Child sat motionless with
his eyes shut, and his head rested on
his little hand, she thought he had
fallen asleep;&mdash;so she poised her double
wings and flew into the rustling wood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Child was only sunk into a
dream of delight, and was wishing <i>he</i>
were a sunbeam or a moonbeam; and
he would have been glad to hear more
and more, and for ever. But at last, as
all was still, he opened his eyes and
looked around for his dear guest; but
she was flown far away; so he could
not bear to sit there any longer alone,
and he rose and went to the gurgling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
brook. It gushed and rolled so
merrily, and tumbled so wildly along
as it hurried to throw itself head-over-heels
into the river, just as if the great,
massy rock out of which it sprang,
were close behind it, and could only
be escaped by a break-neck leap.</p>

<p>Then the Child began to talk to the
little waves, and asked them whence
they came. They would not stay to
give him an answer, but danced away,
one over another; till at last, that the
sweet Child might not be grieved, a
drop of water stopped behind a piece
of rock. From her the Child heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
strange histories, but he could not understand
them all, for she told him
about her former life, and about the
depths of the mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long while ago,&#8221; said the drop of
water, &#8220;I lived with my countless sisters
in the great ocean, in peace and
unity. We had all sorts of pastimes;
sometimes we mounted up high into
the air, and peeped at the stars; then
we sank plump down deep below, and
looked how the coral builders work
till they are tired, that they may reach
the light of day at last. But I was
conceited, and thought myself much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
better than my sisters. And so one
day when the sun rose out of the sea,
I clung fast to one of his hot beams,
and thought that now I should reach
the stars, and become one of them.
But I had not ascended far, when the
sunbeam shook me off, and in spite of
all I could say or do, let me fall into a
dark cloud. And soon a flash of fire
darted through the cloud, and now I
thought I must surely die; but the
whole cloud laid itself down softly upon
the top of a mountain, and so I escaped
with my fright, and a black eye. Now
I thought I should remain hidden, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
all on a sudden, I slipped over a round
pebble, fell from one stone to another,
down into the depths of the mountain,
till at last it was pitch dark, and I could
neither see nor hear any thing. Then I
found, indeed, that &#8216;pride goeth before
a fall,&#8217; resigned myself to my fate, and,
as I had already laid aside all my unhappy
pride in the cloud, my portion
was now the salt of humility; and after
undergoing many purifications from the
hidden virtues of metals and minerals, I
was at length permitted to come up
once more into the free cheerful air;
and now will I run back to my sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and there wait patiently till I am called
to something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>But hardly had she done, when the
root of a forget-me-not caught the drop
of water by her hair and sucked her in,
that she might become a floweret, and
twinkle brightly as a blue star on the
green firmament of earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child did not very well know
what to think of all this; he went
thoughtfully home and laid himself on
his little bed; and all night long he was
wandering about on the ocean, and
among the stars, and over the dark
mountain. But the moon loved to look
on the slumbering Child as he lay with
his little head softly pillowed on his
right arm. She lingered a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
before his little window, and went
slowly away to lighten the dark chamber
of some sick person.</p>

<p>As the moon&#8217;s soft light lay on the
Child&#8217;s eyelids, he fancied he sat in a
golden boat, on a great, great water;
countless stars swam glittering on the
dark mirror. He stretched out his
hand to catch the nearest star, but it
had vanished, and the water sprayed up
against him. Then he saw clearly that
these were not the real stars; he looked
up to heaven, and wished he could fly
thither.</p>

<p>But in the mean time the moon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wandered on her way; and now the
Child was led in his dream into the
clouds, and he thought he was sitting on
a white sheep, and he saw many lambs
grazing around him. He tried to catch
a little lamb to play with, but it was
all mist and vapour; and the Child was
sorrowful, and wished himself down
again in his own meadow, where his
own lamb was sporting gaily about.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the moon was gone to
sleep behind the mountains, and all
around was dark. Then the Child
dreamt that he fell down into the dark,
gloomy caverns of the mountain, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that he was so frightened, that he suddenly
awoke, just as morning opened
her clear eye over the nearest hill.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IV.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child started up, and, to recover
himself from his fright, went into the
little flower-garden behind his cottage,
where the beds were surrounded by
ancient palm-trees, and where he knew
that all the flowers would nod kindly at
him. But behold, the tulip turned up
her nose, and the ranunculus held her
head as stiffly as possible, that she might
not bow good-morrow to him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
rose, with her fair round cheeks, smiled
and greeted the Child lovingly; so
he went up to her and kissed her fragrant
mouth. And then the rose tenderly
complained that he so seldom
came into the garden, and that she
gave out her bloom and her fragrance
the live-long day in vain; for the other
flowers either could not see her, because
they were too low, or did not
care to look at her, because they themselves
were so rich in bloom and fragrance.
But she was most delighted
when she glowed in the blooming head
of a child, and could pour out all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
heart&#8217;s secrets to him in sweet odours.
Among other things, the rose whispered
in his ear that she was the Fulness
of Beauty.</p>

<p>And in truth the Child, while looking
at her beauty, seemed to have quite forgotten
to go on; till the blue larkspur
called to him, and asked whether he
cared nothing more about his faithful
friend; she said that she was unchanged,
and that even in death she should look
upon him with eyes of unfading blue.</p>

<p>The Child thanked her for her true-heartedness,
and passed on to the hyacinth
who stood near the puffy, full-cheeked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gaudy tulips. Even from a
distance the hyacinth sent forth kisses
to him, for she knew not how to express
her love. Although she was
not remarkable for her beauty, yet the
Child felt himself wondrously attracted
by her, for he thought no flower loved
him so well. But the hyacinth poured
out her full heart and wept bitterly,
because she stood so lonely; the tulips
indeed were her countrymen, but they
were so cold and unfeeling that she was
ashamed of them. The Child encouraged
her, and told her he did not think
things were so bad as she fancied. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
tulips spoke their love in bright looks,
while she uttered her&#8217;s in fragrant
words; that these, indeed, were lovelier
and more intelligible, but that the
others were not to be despised.</p>

<p>Then the hyacinth was comforted,
and said she would be content; and the
Child went on to the powdered auricula,
who, in her bashfulness, looked
kindly up to him, and would gladly have
given him more than kind looks, had
she had more to give. But the Child
was satisfied with her modest greeting;
he felt that he was poor too, and he
saw the deep, thoughtful colours that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lay beneath her golden dust. But the
humble flower of her own accord sent
him to her neighbour, the lily, whom
she willingly acknowledged as her
queen. And when the Child came to
the lily, the slender flower waved to
and fro, and bowed her pale head with
gentle pride and stately modesty, and
sent forth a fragrant greeting to him.
The Child knew not what had come
to him: it reached his inmost heart, so
that his eyes filled with soft tears.
Then he marked how the lily gazed
with a clear and steadfast eye upon the
sun, and how the sun looked down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
again into her pure chalice, and how,
amid this interchange of looks, the
three golden threads united in the
centre. And the Child heard how
one scarlet lady-bird at the bottom
of the cup, said to another, &#8220;knowest
thou not that we dwell in the flower of
heaven?&#8221; and the other replied, &#8220;yes,
and now will the mystery be fulfilled.&#8221;
And as the Child saw and heard all
this, the dim image of his unknown
parents, as it were veiled in a holy
light, floated before his eyes: he strove
to grasp it, but the light was gone,
and the Child slipped, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
fallen, had not the branch of a currant
bush<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> caught and held him; and he
took some of the bright berries for his
morning&#8217;s meal, and went back to his
hut and stripped the little branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in the hut he staid not long, all
was so gloomy, close, and silent within;
and abroad every thing seemed to smile,
and to exult in the clear and unbounded
space. Therefore the Child went out
into the green wood, of which the dragonfly
had told him such pleasant
stories. But he found every thing far
more beautiful and lovely even than she
had described it; for all about, wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he went, the tender moss pressed
his little feet, and the delicate grass
embraced his knees, and the flowers
kissed his hands, and even the branches
stroked his cheeks with a kind and
refreshing touch, and the high trees
threw their fragrant shade around him.</p>

<p>There was no end to his delight.
The little birds warbled and sang, and
fluttered and hopped about, and the
delicate wood-flowers gave out their
beauty and their odours; and every
sweet sound took a sweet odour by the
hand, and thus walked through the
open door of the Child&#8217;s heart, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
held a joyous nuptial dance therein.
But the nightingale and the lily of the
valley led the dance; for the nightingale
sang of nought but love, and the lily
breathed of nought but innocence, and
he was the bridegroom and she was the
bride. And the nightingale was never
weary of repeating the same thing a
hundred times over, for the spring of
love which gushed from his heart was
ever new; and the lily bowed her head
bashfully, that no one might see her
glowing heart. And yet the one lived
so solely and entirely in the other, that
no one could see whether the notes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the nightingale were floating lilies, or
the lilies visible notes, falling like dew-drops
from the nightingale&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>The Child&#8217;s heart was full of joy even
to the brim. He set himself down, and
he almost thought he should like to
take root there, and live for ever
among the sweet plants and flowers,
and so become a true sharer in all their
gentle pleasures. For he felt a deep
delight in the still, secluded, twilight
existence of the mosses and small herbs,
which felt not the storm nor the frost,
nor the scorching sunbeam; but dwelt
quietly among their many friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
neighbours, feasting in peace and good
fellowship on the dew and the cool shadows
which the mighty trees shed upon
them. To them it was a high festival
when a sunbeam chanced to visit their
lowly home; whilst the tops of the lofty
trees could find joy and beauty only in
the purple rays of morning or evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> as the Child sat there, a little
mouse rustled from among the dry
leaves of the former year, and a lizard
half glided from a crevice in the rock,
and both of them fixed their bright eyes
upon the little stranger; and when they
saw that he designed them no evil, they
took courage and came nearer to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to live with you,&#8221; said
the Child to the two little creatures, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a soft subdued voice, that he might not
frighten them. &#8220;Your chambers are so
snug, so warm, and yet so shaded, and
the flowers grow in at your windows,
and the birds sing you their morning
song, and call you to table and to bed
with their clear warblings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the mouse, &#8220;it would
be all very well if all the plants bore
nuts and mast, instead of those silly
flowers; and if I were not obliged to
grub under ground in the spring, and
gnaw the bitter roots, whilst they are
dressing themselves in their fine flowers
and flaunting it to the world, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they had endless stores of honey in
their cellars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; interrupted the
lizard pertly, &#8220;do you think, because
you are grey, that other people must
throw away their handsome clothes,
or let them lie in the dark wardrobe
under ground, and wear nothing but
grey too? I am not so envious. The
flowers may dress themselves as they
like for me; they pay for it out of
their own pockets, and they feed bees
and beetles from their cups; but what I
want to know is, of what use are birds
in the world? Such a fluttering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
chattering, truly, from morning early
to evening late, that one is worried and
stunned to death, and there is never a
day&#8217;s peace for them. And they do
nothing; only snap up the flies and the
spiders out of the mouths of such as I.
For my part, I should be perfectly
satisfied, provided all the birds in the
world were flies and beetles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Child changed colour, and his
heart was sick and saddened when he
heard their evil tongues. He could not
imagine how any body could speak ill
of the beautiful flowers, or scoff at his
beloved birds. He was waked out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a sweet dream, and the wood seemed
to him lonely and desert, and he was
ill at ease. He started up hastily, so
that the mouse and the lizard shrank
back alarmed, and did not look around
them till they thought themselves safe
out of the reach of the stranger with
the large, severe eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Child went away from the
place; and as he hung down his head
thoughtfully, he did not observe that
he took the wrong path, nor see how
the flowers on either side bowed their
heads to welcome him, nor hear how
the old birds from the boughs, and the
young from the nests, cried aloud to
him, &#8220;God bless thee, our dear little
prince.&#8221; And he went on and on, farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and farther, into the deep wood;
and he thought over the foolish and
heartless talk of the two selfish chatterers,
and could not understand it.
He would fain have forgotten it, but
he could not. And the more he pondered,
the more it seemed to him as
if a malicious spider had spun her web
around him, and as if his eyes were
weary with trying to look through it.</p>

<p>And suddenly he came to a still
water, above which young beeches
lovingly entwined their arms. He
looked in the water, and his eyes were
riveted to it as if by enchantment. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
could not move, but stood and gazed
in the soft, placid mirror, from the bosom
of which the tender green foliage,
with the deep blue heavens between,
gleamed so wondrously upon him. His
sorrow was all forgotten, and even the
echo of the discord in his little heart
was hushed. That heart was once
more in his eyes; and fain would he
have drunk in the soft beauty of the
colours that lay beneath him, or have
plunged into the lovely deep.</p>

<p>Then the breeze began to sigh among
the tree-tops. The Child raised his
eyes and saw overhead the quivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
green, and the deep blue behind it, and
he knew not whether he were waking
or dreaming: which were the real
leaves and the real heaven,&mdash;those in
the depths above, or in the depths
beneath? Long did the Child waver,
and his thoughts floated in a delicious
dreaminess from one to the other,
till the dragonfly flew to him in affectionate
haste, and with rustling wings
greeted her kind host. The Child returned
her greeting, and was glad to
meet an acquaintance with whom he
could share the rich feast of his joy.
But first he asked the dragonfly if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
could decide for him between the Upper
and the Nether&mdash;the heighth and
the depth? The dragonfly flew above,
and beneath, and around; but the
water spake: &#8220;The foliage and the
sky above are not the true ones: the
leaves wither and fall; the sky is
often overcast, and sometimes quite
dark.&#8221; Then the leaves and the sky
said, &#8220;The water only apes us; it
must change its pictures at our pleasure,
and can retain none.&#8221; Then the
dragonfly remarked, that the heighth
and the depth existed only in the eyes
of the Child, and that the leaves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the sky were true and real only in his
thoughts; because in the mind alone
the picture was permanent and enduring,
and could be carried with him
whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>This she said to the Child; but she
immediately warned him to return, for
the leaves were already beating the
tattoo in the evening breeze, and the
lights were disappearing one by one
in every corner. Then the Child
confessed to her with alarm that he
knew not how he should find the way
back, and that he feared the dark night
would overtake him if he attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
go home alone; so the dragonfly flew
on before him, and shewed him a cave
in the rock where he might pass the
night. And the Child was well content;
for he had often wished to try
if he could sleep out of his accustomed
bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the dragonfly was fleet, and gratitude
strengthened her wings to pay her
host the honour she owed him. And
truly in the dim twilight good counsel
and guidance were scarce. She flitted
hither and thither without knowing
rightly what was to be done; when, by
the last vanishing sunbeam, she saw
hanging on the edge of the cave some
strawberries who had drunk so deep of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the evening-red, that their heads were
quite heavy. Then she flew up to a
harebell who stood near, and whispered
in her ear that the lord and king of all
the flowers was in the wood, and ought
to be received and welcomed as beseemed
his dignity. Aglaia did not
need that this should be repeated. She
began to ring her sweet bells with all
her might; and when her neighbour
heard the sound, she rang hers also; and
soon all the harebells, great and small,
were in motion, and rang as if it had
been for the nuptials of their mother
earth herself, with the prince of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sun. The tone of the blue bells was
deep and rich, and that of the white,
high and clear, and all blended together
in a delicious harmony.</p>

<p>But the birds were fast asleep in their
high nests, and the ears of the other
animals were not delicate enough, or
were too much overgrown with hair, to
hear them. The fireflies alone heard
the joyous peal, for they were akin to
the flowers, through their common ancestor,
light. They inquired of their
nearest relation, the lily of the valley,
and from her they heard that a large
flower had just passed along the foot-path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more blooming than the loveliest
rose, and with two stars more brilliant
than those of the brightest firefly, and
that it must needs be their king. Then
all the fireflies flew up and down the
foot path, and sought every where, till
at length they came, as the dragonfly
had hoped they would, to the cave.</p>

<p>And now, as they looked at the Child,
and every one of them saw itself reflected
in his clear eyes, they rejoiced
exceedingly, and called all their fellows
together, and alighted on the bushes all
around; and soon it was so light in the
cave, that herb and grass began to grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as if it had been broad day. Now,
indeed, was the joy and triumph of the
dragonfly complete. The Child was
delighted with the merry and silvery
tones of the bells, and with the many
little bright-eyed companions around
him, and with the deep red strawberries
which bowed down their head to his
touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> when he had eaten his fill, he sat
down on the soft moss, crossed one
little leg over the other, and began to
gossip with the fireflies. And as he so
often thought on his unknown parents,
he asked them who were their parents.
Then the one nearest to him gave him
answer; and he told how that they
were formerly flowers, but none of those
who thrust their rooty hands greedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
into the ground and draw nourishment
from the dingy earth, only to make
themselves fat and large withal; but
that the light was dearer to them than
any thing, even at night; and while the
other flowers slept, they gazed unwearied
on the light, and drank it in
with eager adoration,&mdash;sun and moon
and star light. And the light had so
thoroughly purified them, that they had
not sucked in poisonous juices like the
yellow flowers of the earth, but sweet
odours for sick and fainting hearts,
and oil of potent, ethereal virtue for
the weak and the wounded; and, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
length, when their autumn came, they
did not, like the others, wither and sink
down, leaf and flower, to be swallowed
up by the darksome earth, but shook
off their earthly garment and mounted
aloft into the clear air. But there it
was so wondrously bright, that sight
failed them; and when they came to
themselves again, they were fireflies,
each sitting on a withered flower-stalk.</p>

<p>And now the Child liked the bright-eyed
flies better than ever; and he
talked a little longer with them, and
inquired why they shewed themselves
so much more in spring. They did it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they said, in the hope that their gold-green
radiance might allure their cousins,
the flowers, to the pure love of
light.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> this conversation the dragonfly
had been preparing a bed for her host.
The moss upon which the Child sat
had grown a foot high behind his back,
out of pure joy; but the dragonfly and
her sisters had so revelled upon it, that
it was now laid at its length along the
cave. The dragonfly had awakened
every spider in the neighbourhood out
of her sleep, and when they saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
brilliant light, they had set to work
spinning so industriously that their web
hung down like a curtain before the
mouth of the cave. But as the Child
saw the ant peeping up at him, he entreated
the fireflies not to deprive themselves
any longer of their merry games
in the wood, on his account. And the
dragonfly and her sisters raised the curtain
till the Child had laid him down to
rest, and then let it fall again, that
the mischievous gnats might not get in
to disturb his slumbers.</p>

<p>The Child laid himself down to sleep,
for he was very tired; but he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sleep, for his couch of moss was quite
another thing than his little bed, and
the cave was all strange to him. He
turned himself on one side and then on
the other, and as nothing would do, he
raised himself and sat upright to wait
till sleep might choose to come. But
sleep would not come at all;&mdash;and the
only wakeful eyes in the whole wood
were the Child&#8217;s. For the harebells
had rung themselves weary, and the
fireflies had flown about till they were
tired, and even the dragonfly, who
would fain have kept watch in front of
the cave, had dropped sound asleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>The wood grew stiller and stiller:
here and there fell a dry leaf which had
been driven from its old dwelling place
by a fresh one; here and there a young
bird gave a soft chirp when its mother
squeezed it in the nest;&mdash;and from time
to time a gnat hummed for a minute or
two in the curtain, till a spider crept on
tip-toe along its web, and gave him
such a gripe in the wind-pipe as soon
spoiled his trumpeting.</p>

<p>And the deeper the silence became,
the more intently did the Child listen,
and at last the slightest sound thrilled
him from head to foot. At length, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was still as death in the wood; and the
world seemed as if it never would
wake again. The Child bent forward
to see whether it were as dark abroad
as in the cave, but he saw nothing save
the pitch dark night, who had wrapped
every thing in her thick veil. Yet as
he looked upwards his eyes met the
friendly glance of two or three stars, and
this was a most joyful surprise to him,
for he felt himself no longer so entirely
alone. The stars were, indeed, far, far
away, but yet he knew them, and they
knew him; for they looked into his
eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>The Child&#8217;s whole soul was fixed in
his gaze; and it seemed to him as if he
must needs fly out of the darksome
cave, thither where the stars were
beaming with such pure and serene
light; and he felt how poor and lowly
he was, when he thought of their brilliancy;
and how cramped and fettered,
when he thought of their free,
unbounded course along the heavens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the stars went on their course, and
left their glittering picture only a little
while before the Child&#8217;s eyes. Even
this faded, and then vanished quite
away. And he was beginning to feel
tired, and to wish to lay himself down
again, when a flickering will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
appeared from behind a bush,&mdash;so that
the Child thought, at first, one of the
stars had wandered out of its way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
had come to visit him, and to take him
with it. And the Child breathed quick
with joy and surprise, and then the
will-o&#8217;-the-wisp came nearer and set
himself down on a damp, mossy stone
in front of the cave, and another fluttered
quickly after him, and sat down
over against him and sighed deeply,
&#8220;Thank God, then, that I can rest at
last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;for that you
may thank the innocent Child who
sleeps there within; it was his pure
breath that freed us.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Are you then,&#8221;
said the Child, hesitatingly, &#8220;not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
yon stars which wander so brightly
there above?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Oh, if we were stars,&#8221;
replied the first, &#8220;we should pursue
our tranquil path through the pure element,
and should leave this wood and
the whole darksome earth to itself.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;And
not,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;sit brooding
on the face of the shallow pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Child was curious to know who
these could be who shone so beautifully,
and yet seemed so discontented. Then,
the first began to relate how he had
been a child too, and how, as he grew
up, it had always been his greatest delight
to deceive people and play them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tricks, to show his wit and cleverness.
He had always, he said, poured such a
stream of smooth words over people,
and encompassed himself with such a
shining mist, that men had been attracted by
it to their own hurt. But
once on a time there appeared a plain
man who only spoke two or three simple
words, and suddenly the bright
mist vanished, and left him naked and
deformed, to the scorn and mockery
of the whole world. But the man
had turned away his face from him in
pity, while he was almost dead with
shame and anger. And when he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to himself again, he knew not what
had befallen him, till, at length, he
found that it was his fate to hover,
without rest or change, over the surface
of the bog as a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me it fell out quite otherwise,&#8221;
said the first: &#8220;Instead of
giving light without warmth, as I now
do, I burned without shining. When
I was only a child, people gave way
to me in every thing, so that I was intoxicated
with self-love. If I saw any
one shine, I longed to put out his light;
and the more intensely I wished this,
the more did my own small glimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
turn back upon myself, and inwardly
burn fiercely, while all without was
darker than ever. But if any one who
shone more brightly would have kindly
given me of his light, then did my inward
flame burst forth to destroy him
But the flame passed through the light
and harmed it not; it shone only the
more brightly, while I was withered and
exhausted. And once upon a time I met
a little smiling child, who played with
a cross of palm branches, and wore a
beamy coronet around his golden locks.
He took me kindly by the hand and
said, &#8216;My friend, you are now very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
gloomy and sad, but if you will become
a child again, even as I am, you will
have a bright circlet such as I have.&#8217;
When I heard that, I was so angry
with myself and with the child, that I
was scorched by my inward fire. Now
would I fain fly up to the sun to fetch
rays from him, but the rays drove
me back with these words: &#8216;Return
thither whence thou camest, thou dark
fire of envy, for the sun lightens only in
love; the greedy earth, indeed, sometimes
turns his mild light into scorching
fire. Fly back, then, for with thy
like alone must thou dwell.&#8217; I fell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and when I recovered myself, I was
glimmering coldly above the stagnant
waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they were talking, the Child
had fallen asleep; for he knew nothing
of the world nor of men, and he could
make nothing of their stories. Weariness
had spoken a more intelligible
language to him&mdash;<i>that</i> he understood,
and had fallen asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Softly</span> and soundly he slept till the
rosy morning clouds stood upon the
mountain, and announced the coming
of their lord, the sun. But as soon as
the tidings spread over field and wood,
the thousand-voiced echo awoke, and
sleep was no more to be thought of.</p>

<p>And soon did the royal sun himself
arise; at first, his dazzling diadem alone
appeared above the mountains; at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
length, he stood upon their summit in
the full majesty of his beauty, in all
the charms of eternal youth, bright and
glorious, his kindly glance embracing
every creature of earth, from the stately
oak to the blade of grass bending under
the foot of the wayfaring man.</p>

<p>Then arose from every breast, from
every throat, the joyous song of praise;
and it was as if the whole plain and
wood were become a temple, whose
roof was the heaven, whose altar the
mountain, whose congregation all creatures,
whose priest the sun.</p>

<p>But the Child walked forth and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
glad, for the birds sang sweetly, and it
seemed to him as if every thing sported
and danced out of mere joy to be alive.
Here flew two finches through the
thicket, and, twittering, pursued each
other; there, the young buds burst
asunder, and the tender leaves peeped
out and expanded themselves in the
warm sun, as if they would abide
in his glance for ever; here, a dewdrop
trembled, sparkling and twinkling
on a blade of grass, and knew
not that beneath him stood a little
moss who was thirsting after him;
there, troops of flies flew aloft, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they would soar far, far over the wood:
and so all was life and motion, and
the Child&#8217;s heart joyed to see it.</p>

<p>He sat down on a little smooth plot
of turf, shaded by the branches of a
nut-bush, and thought he should now
sip the cup of his delight, drop by
drop. And first he plucked down some
brambles which threatened him with
their prickles; then he bent aside some
branches which concealed the view;
then he removed the stones, so that
he might stretch out his feet at full
length on the soft turf; and when he
had done all this, he bethought himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
what was yet to do; and as he found
nothing, he stood up to look for his acquaintance
the dragonfly, and to beg
her to guide him once more out of the
wood into the open fields. About midway
he met her, and she began to excuse
herself for having fallen asleep in
the night. The Child thought not of
the past, were it even but a minute
ago, so earnestly did he now wish to
get out from among the thick and close
trees; for his heart beat high, and he
felt as if he should breathe freer in the
open ground. The dragonfly flew on
before and shewed him the way as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as the outermost verge of the wood,
whence the Child could espy his own
little hut, and then flew away to her
playfellows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child walked forth alone upon the
fresh, dewy corn-field. A thousand little
suns glittered in his eyes, and a lark
soared warbling above his head. And
the lark proclaimed the joys of the coming
year, and awakened endless hopes,
while she soared circling higher and
higher, till, at length, her song was like
the soft whisper of an angel holding converse
with the spring, under the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
arch of heaven. The Child had seen the
earth-coloured little bird rise up before
him, and it seemed to him as if the
earth had sent her forth from her bosom
as a messenger to carry her joy and
her thanks up to the sun, because he
had turned his beaming countenance
again upon her in love and bounty.
And the lark hung poised above the
hope-giving field, and warbled her clear
and joyous song.</p>

<p>She sang of the loveliness of the rosy
dawn, and the fresh brilliancy of the
earliest sunbeams; of the gladsome
springing of the young flowers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
vigorous shooting of the corn; and her
song pleased the Child beyond measure.</p>

<p>But the lark wheeled in higher and
higher circles, and her song sounded
softer and sweeter.</p>

<p>And now she sang of the first delights
of early love; of wanderings together
on the sunny, fresh hill-tops, and of the
sweet pictures and visions that arise
out of the blue and misty distance.
The Child understood not rightly what
he heard, and fain would he have understood,
for he thought that even in
such visions must be wondrous delight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He gazed aloft after the unwearied
bird, but she had disappeared in the
morning mist.</p>

<p>Then the Child leaned his head on
one shoulder to listen if he could no
longer hear the little messenger of
spring; and he could just catch the
distant and quivering notes in which
she sang of the fervent longing after
the clear element of freedom; after
the pure, all-present light; and of the
blessed foretaste of this desired enfranchisement,
of this blending in the sea
of celestial happiness.</p>

<p>Yet longer did he listen; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
tones of her song carried him there,
where, as yet, his thoughts had never
reached, and he felt himself happier in
this short and imperfect flight than ever
he had felt before. But the lark now
dropped suddenly to the earth, for her
little body was too heavy for the ambient
æther, and her wings were not
large nor strong enough for the pure
element.</p>

<p>Then the red corn-poppies laughed
at the homely looking bird, and cried
to one another and to the surrounding
blades of corn, in a shrill voice, &#8220;Now,
indeed, you may see what comes of
flying so high, and striving and straining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
after mere air; people only lose their
time, and bring back nothing but weary
wings and an empty stomach. That
vulgar-looking ill-dressed little creature
would fain raise herself above us all,
and has kept up a mighty noise. And
now there she lies on the ground and
can hardly breathe, while we have stood
still where we are sure of a good
meal, and have staid like people of
sense where there is something substantial
to be had; and in the time
she has been fluttering and singing,
we have grown a good deal taller and
fatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other little red-caps chattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and screamed their assent so loud, that
the Child&#8217;s ears tingled, and he wished
he could chastise them for their spiteful
jeers; when a cyane said, in a soft
voice, to her younger playmates, &#8220;Dear
friends, be not led astray by outward
show, nor by discourse, which regards
only outward show. The lark is, indeed,
weary, and the space into which
she has soared is void; but the void is
not what the lark sought, nor is the
seeker returned empty home. She
strove after light and freedom, and light
and freedom has she proclaimed. She
left the earth and its enjoyments, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
she has drunk of the pure air of heaven,
and has seen that it is not the earth, but
the sun that is steadfast. And if earth
has called her back, it can keep nothing
of her but what is its own. Her sweet
voice and her soaring wings belong to
the sun, and will enter into light and
freedom, long after the foolish prater
shall have sunk and been buried in the
dark prison of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the lark heard her wise and
friendly discourse, and with renewed
strength, she sprang once more into
the clear and beautiful blue.</p>

<p>Then the Child clapped his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hands for joy, that the sweet bird had
flown up again, and that the red-caps
must hold their tongues for shame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the Child was become happy and
joyful, and breathed freely again, and
thought no more of returning to his
hut, for he saw that nothing returned
inwards, but rather that all strove outwards
into the free air; the rosy apple
blossoms from their narrow buds, and
the gurgling notes from the narrow
breast of the lark. The germs burst
open the folding doors of the seeds,
and broke through the heavy pressure
of the earth in order to get at the light:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the grasses tore asunder their bands,
and their slender blades sprung upwards.
Even the rocks were become gentle,
and allowed little mosses to peep out
from their sides, as a sign that they
would not remain impenetrably closed
for ever. And the flowers sent out
colour and fragrance into the whole
world, for they kept not their best
for themselves, but would imitate the
sun and the stars, which poured their
warmth and radiance over the spring.
And many a little gnat and beetle burst
the narrow cell in which it was enclosed,
and crept out slowly, and, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
asleep, unfolded and shook its tender
wings, and soon gained strength, and
flew off to untried delights.</p>

<p>And as the butterflies came forth
from their chrysalids in all their gaiety
and splendour, so did every humbled
and suppressed aspiration and hope free
itself, and boldly launch into the open
and flowing sea of spring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My sole object has been to put together all that presented itself
to my own heart and mind as most persuasive, consolatory, or elevating,
in such a form and order as to be easy of reference, conveniently
arranged and divided, and freed from matter either hard to
be understood, unattractive, or unprofitable (to say the least) for
young and pure eyes.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Preface.</i></p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="antiqua">Critical Notices of the Work.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This Selection is executed with judgment and taste. Religious
parents will esteem themselves happy in having such a reading-book
to put into the hands of their children; and if they themselves
have not so familiarly used the Bible, that they cannot instantly
lay their finger on the precise passage in accordance with their
wants or feelings, they will be glad of so pleasant and so instructive
a guide as these Selections. It may be called, without profanation,
the beauties of the Bible; we may add, that no work
under that title ever presented its extracts with less appearance
of being fractured, or torn up violently from the parent mass.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Austin has performed her humble but laborious task in a
manner that reflects much credit on her heart and judgment. As a
sacred lesson-book for children, we have seen none to be compared
to this. The compiler is entitled to the best thanks of the religious
world, and especially of every parent.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no doubt of the excellent intentions of the compiler
of the work. It has been arranged with care, and an attentive
perusal by young persons cannot fail to be morally serviceable.
Nothing but a conviction of the utility of such a work could have
induced her to undertake it, and we wish it success, acknowledging
that it may be beneficially made a class school-book for young children.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The object is an excellent one, and the mode of execution has
our warmest approbation.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Asiatic Journal.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It appears to us that this work removes the only valid objection
that can be urged against putting the Scriptures into the hands of
the rising generation. We wish that we had sufficient space to do
justice to this estimable undertaking. Every parent who has the
eternal welfare of a family at heart will hail this lady as a friend
and a benefactress.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Metropolitan Magazine.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The plan is very original, and, in our view of the matter, excellently
adapted to its purpose. The labour of the compilation must
have been long, serious, and severe, but it seems to have been
employed to excellent purpose. In schools, and as a class and
instruction book for children, it is admirably adapted. Mothers
will adopt it, and we feel no doubt of its obtaining a wide and most
useful circulation amongst all who desire to make Scripture truths
the foundation of a religious and moral education. It presents, in
fact, the Bible in a totally new, and therefore freshly interesting
view, as a book of divine and moral truth.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Norwich Mercury.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Austin has done her work well; and we recommend it
to the attention of all those whose faith has not altogether usurped
the place of their reason.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bell&#8217;s New Weekly Messenger.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Selections, we believe, are now generally used in schools, but
none that have fallen under our own notice at all equal the present
attempt. It is not every one that can be intrusted with making
these Selections. The present is made by Mrs. Austin, a lady distinguished
for many accomplishments, and particularly for her singular
power of not translating, but transmuting German books into
English ones.&#8221;&mdash;<i>United Kingdom.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to us, that illustrations better calculated to impress
upon young persons clear and striking views of the Divine attributes,
of the human condition, and of religious and moral obligations,
could with difficulty have been extracted from such materials
as the Old Testament offers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;With great taste has Mrs. Austin selected from these materials,
and with sound judgment arranged her selections. Passages
on the same topic are brought together from different places, and
interwoven with great skill, so as to read continuously and fluently.
These selections are, in fact, the spirit of the Old Testament, disengaged
from local and temporary appendages; and we do not see
why they might not be used in the pulpit as well as in schools.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Monthly
Repository.</i></p></blockquote>

a number of plain <i>practical</i> sentences, such as are wanted in the common intercourse
of life, and are made familiar by exercises of a similar kind. The Tables of Declensions
and Conjugations are also admirably clear. It is almost impossible to represent
sound to the eye; yet the rules of Pronunciation laid down in this book are so systematic
and precise as to render them a great help to those who have had some oral
instruction. The Appendix, or a &#8216;Dictionary of Difficulties,&#8217; which also sells separately,
will be found an excellent book of reference to the more advanced student,
more useful than French works of this kind, as it is evidently the work of a man who,

of a series of remarkably well-written and interesting Tales of the olden time, with
Illustrations by George Cruikshank. Of these Illustrations it is scarcely possible
to speak in any other than terms of unqualified praise&mdash;they combine so much of
the ludicrous and the terrible, and are so completely in Cruikshank&#8217;s best style, that
we feel justified in expressing an opinion that this publication will even add to
that unrivalled artist&#8217;s fame. The volume is altogether well got up&mdash;the printing is

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
